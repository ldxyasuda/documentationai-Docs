## Real-Time Order Receipt and Delivery Tracking

You track every order stage in L-DX, from customer receipt to final delivery. The system syncs data across platforms, providing live updates to your team.

Use the API to fetch live order status:

<CodeGroup tabs="JavaScript,Python">
  ```javascript
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/v1/orders/12345', {
    headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${YOUR_API_KEY}` }
  });
  const order = await response.json();
  console.log(order.status); // 'shipped'
  ```
  ```python
  import requests
  response = requests.get(
    'https://api.example.com/v1/orders/12345',
    headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {YOUR_API_KEY}'}
  )
  order = response.json()
  print(order['status'])  # 'shipped'
  ```
